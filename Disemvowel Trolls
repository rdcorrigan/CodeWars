Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

// JavaScript
function disemvowel(str) {
  str = str.replace((/[aeiou]/gi), "");
  return str;
}

// Python
def disemvowel(string_):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    result = ''
    for letter in string_:
        if letter not in vowels:
            result += letter
    return result
    
def disemvowel(string_):
    table = string_.maketrans(dict.fromkeys('aeiouAEIOU'))
    return string_.translate(table)
